            <h2>🧵 The Fabric That Faded Across Oceans</h2>
            <p class="article-summary">Before it became a symbol of Ivy League summer wear, Madras Checks was a living, bleeding cloth — hand-dyed in Tamil Nadu, steeped in natural dyes, and soaked in centuries of trade, ritual, and memory.</p>
            <div class="article-full">
              <p>Madras Checks — or Madras kattam in Tamil — began not as fashion, but as function: cooling cotton lungis worn by workers under humid South Indian suns. But woven into each square was more than just color: turmeric, indigo, sesame oil, rice starch, and memory.</p>
              <p>In the 16th century, Tamil merchants began trading these checked fabrics with Arab and Portuguese sailors, sending bolts of vibrant cloth to West Africa. There, the Kalabari people named it Injiri — a word derived from “India” — and used it in rituals surrounding birth, death, and marriage.</p>
              <p>British traders took note. By the 19th century, Scottish regiments stationed in Madras began wearing checked fabrics reminiscent of tartans. This blend of Indian dye craft and Western visual language gave birth to a global hybrid.</p>
              <p>By the 1950s, Madras Checks landed in the American prep school circuit — fading irregularly with each wash. The cloth’s imperfections became its authenticity. “Bleeding Madras” was born.</p>
              <p>And now, with code as the loom and Ordinals as the archive, Madras Checks continues its journey — not on ships, but in blocks, hashes, and pixels.</p>

            <h2>🎨 Weaving Memory into Code: Why Madras Checks Still Matter</h2>
            <p class="article-summary">From handloom to HTML, Madras Checks is more than aesthetic — it’s a map of resistance, migration, and memory.</p>
            <div class="article-full">
              <p>A check is not just a pattern. It’s a negotiation.</p>
              <p>Each horizontal thread in a Madras cloth meets a vertical one — a point of tension, a moment of possibility. The weave is tight, but never rigid. It shifts. It breathes. It bleeds.</p>
              <p>To turn this into generative code is not a gimmick. It’s a ritual. Each script, each seed, each minified HTML block carries the echoes of a loom once dug into the red earth of Tamil Nadu.</p>
              <p>Madras Checks are memory — of lost dyes, banned exports, colonial rebranding. They were once priced in pounds, taxed in bales, auctioned in London. But they were born barefoot, dyed in turmeric, dried under monsoon skies.</p>
              <p>By encoding them into Ordinals — fully on-chain artworks stitched from logic — we ask:<br>Can code remember?<br>Can pixels carry resistance?</p>
              <p>This project doesn’t just mimic Madras Checks. It continues them.</p>

            <h2>🪡 The Hidden Labor Behind the Checks</h2>
            <p class="article-summary">Long before “Madras” became a marketing term, entire villages in South India sustained generations by weaving the cloth you now wear as shorts, shirts, or nostalgia.</p>
            <div class="article-full">
              <p>Kurinjipadi. Chirala. Nagapattinam. These aren’t fashion capitals. They’re weaving towns — many with looms still sunken into pits, with hands moving shuttles between warps soaked in oil and rice paste.</p>
              <p>When we talk about Madras Checks, we must also speak about who makes them. About the older woman who knows when a thread will break by sound. About the child who carries the dyed yarn to dry. About the man who whistles a rhythm as he treads the loom’s pedals with bare feet.</p>
              <p>British colonial rule industrialized Madras Checks. Swiss companies made millions exporting it as handkerchiefs to West Africa. Ivy League marketers sold “bleeding Madras” as an aesthetic accident. But the labor — the actual weaving — stayed anonymous.</p>
              <p>This project aims to do something different.</p>
              <p>To render each thread as visible, to remind the world that tradition isn’t stuck in the past. It’s in the hands that still remember.</p>
              <p>And soon — those hands may weave your minted Madras Checks into real cloth.</p>
